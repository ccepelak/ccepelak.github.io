  <i>Hi!</i> I’m glad you’re here.

<b>My name is Christine</b> and I’m a <i>Senior Analytics Consultant</i> at Blue Cross Blue Shield, an <i>Analytics Mentor</i> at Thinkful, and a data volunteer at <a href="https://www.techforcampaigns.org/about-us"><i>Tech for Campaigns</i></a>. I care deeply about social issues and in my spare time can be found exploring the world’s coffee shops, teaching yoga classes & hiking in national parks.
